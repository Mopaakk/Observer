            <p>There was no trace of Dr. Vigo, but his entire group was dead. How long had they been trapped there? Emaciated bodies lay where they had collapsed, draped in flies as if wrapped in shrouds. Their chests were torn open, organs devoured.
            I dug a pit under the relentless rain. The effort, combined with the cold and wet, drained me. I pulled the first body through the mud from the lab to the grave, leaving a trail of offal. Crows gathered quickly, taking flight with harsh cries of murder every time I returned with another corpse. As soon as my back was turned, they descended again, feasting on the entrails with increasing speed. 
            The last body was the smallest, a child. Her face lingered in my memory, eyes vacant. The crows, now sated, did not stir. I kicked them away and dragged the girl's body through the mud, too weak to even shoulder her. Night descended as I shoveled earth back into the mass grave. The crows, deprived of their feast, cawed mournfully.
            Five years later, when I was ordered to return, I knew Vigo had been at it again. The new lab was built directly over the old grave. He didnâ€™t even bother to conceal it. As we faced the Spider for the first time, memories of that night, the pit, and the child's face surged up from the sodden earth and my recollection.
            We never located the grave I had once dug. Countless sleepless nights. Countless decaying laboratories. Countless pits unearthed in soil repeatedly disturbed, tilled a hundred times over by a line of hunters who buried the dead only to slay them anew.
            But it was the girl's eye, glaring as the spider's face, shrieking, begging, spitting. The toxic bile seared my eyes like hellfire. Blinded, I staggered out of its nest, desperately clawing at my eyes to clear the burning.
            Seeing that eye, it dawned on me that Vigo might be responsible. But it couldn't be. Even in his darkest imaginings, he lacked the capacity. This spider was the creation of something far more malevolent. More ancient. Eyes. It's aways in the eyes. His eye.</p>
