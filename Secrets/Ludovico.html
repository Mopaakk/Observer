            <p>In a silent room, pressing your ear against a pillow allows you to hear your heartbeat. 
                When I was a child, those muted, rhythmic thumps resembled soft footsteps on a carpeted
                floor. Nearly every night, just as I was about to fall asleep, I would hear those
                "footsteps" and be jolted awake, filled with fear. Throughout my childhood, my mother 
                and I lived in a decent neighborhood that was undergoing a transition. More families 
                with lower incomes, including us, were moving in. Our home was the kind you often see 
                being transported in two parts on the highway, but my mom kept it well-maintained. 
                During the day, I would explore the surrounding woods, finding them full of adventure. 
                However, at night, they took on a more sinister atmosphere, as things often do in the 
                mind of a child. Our house had a large crawlspace underneath, which only added to my 
                overactive imagination. Thoughts of monsters and inescapable dangers would fill my 
                mind, especially when I was jolted awake by the phantom footsteps. I told my mom about 
                the footsteps, but she dismissed them as figments of my imagination. I insisted so much 
                that one day she used a turkey baster to squirt water into my ears, hoping to reassure 
                me, although it didn’t help. Despite the eerie atmosphere and the phantom footsteps, the 
                only strange occurrence was that sometimes I’d wake up on the bottom bunk despite going 
                to sleep on the top. This wasn’t particularly odd since I’d often get up to piss or grab 
                a drink and then just crawl back into the bottom bunk. Being an only child, it didn’t 
                really matter. This happened once or twice a week and wasn’t too frightening. But one 
                night, I didn’t wake up on the bottom bunk.
