          <br>Verily, through yon endless reaches of this dark dimension, hath we made a wondrous discovery. 
          A tower, akin to a lighthouse amidst a vast ocean of mist, doth beckon us with its enchanting 
          music. Some amongst us did recognize the melody, and swiftly traversed the fog to discover the
          tower, deserted by its erstwhile inhabitants.
          <br>
          <br>AFTERNOON
          <br>I still lack a clear image of who dwelt within yon tower, save that they relished writing and
          drinking, and diligently chronicled the souls ensnared within this realm.
          <br>
          <br>NIGHT
          <br>Some dub our sojourning abode as Dunwitch manor, while others favor the Arkham Hotel, and our
          cook, Wibur, doth insist on the Dunwitch manor, likening it to a tale from a dime 
          comic he once perused, drawn from the quill of Lovecraft. We hath cleared the chambers, and I have
          taken possession of the study wherein I discovered vinyl records and cassettes recounting tales 
          and musings of the prior dweller. The House, my preferred appelation, harbors artifacts and 
          contrivances from other realms i presume, whose workings do perplex. Yonder in the cellar, one 
          mirror do intrigue us grievously—it doth emit a blue energy and seem to conjure memories from the 
          very air. Until its nature be comprehended, I have enjoined the forbidding of the basement.
          <br>
          <br>POSTSCRIPT
          <br>A few amongst us did read tales and partook of a modicum of whiskey ere retiring to our beds.
          'Twas indeed fine fare, serving to alleviate the cares of the day. I myself have commenced the study of the documents left by the last dweller or dwellers of this tower. Especial interest did I find in <a href="Secrets/Spider.html" class="shh">one parchment</a> discovered within a most exquisite throne room. The chamber itself was strange, a disarray of papers and records, yet this one doth captivate me.

          <div id="chapter2" class="text">MORNING
          <br>Sithence we have arrived at the towre, Mary hath spent most of her tyme perusing the tales and journales left by the former dwellers. She keepeth a journale of her own and is resolv'd to penne a play about our collective experience. The other day I glanced over her sholder to see what she was inscribing in her booke. To my astonishment, she had transcribed an entire discourse betwixt the twinnes. I cleared my throate to secure her attention. She turn'd around, startl'd, gazing at me with what I could onely describe as a fell looke. It was as though I had interrupted the writing of the Magna Carta. I questioned the decorum and morality of eavesdropping. She questioned the decorum and morality of reading over her sholder. She then added that aught and all is fair game for a writer.
          <br>
          <br>AFTERNOON
          <br>I went up to mine favoured place on the roof of the towre, where I did hearken to memories inscribed on vinyl records by one of the former dwellers, whose vanishing remaineth a mystery. The air smelled of ammonia and wet leaves; the fog tossed and heaved and rolled endlessly toward the horizon as laughter and arguments rose from the ninth floor. Donald the carpenter and a few others built a mini-putt from sundry things of other realms for our mirth and entertainment.
          <br>
          <br>NIGHT
          <br>Life here is an unrelenting strife against alienation, anxietie, melancholy, and ennui. The mini-putt doth bring some relief. The tales, likewise. We each take turns reading them. Mary carrieth it to another level and performeth them. Before she became a writer, she was a soldier, given to lightening the mood by the same means. With all these diversions, 'tis a comfort to forget the terrors of this world and the hard struggle to maintain our wits.
          <br>
          <br>POSTSCRIPT
          <br>I chanced upon a hidden chamber in the passage betwixt the throne room and the kitchen whilst Wilbur and I were sweeping away the cobwebs. 'Tis a vast, seemingly endless library. We delved no further, resolving to explore it with Mary at another time. Yet I did espy a safe with the pass-word upon it. Ludovico. It figures. There was naught within.
          </div>
          
          <div id="chapter3" class="text">AFTERNOON
          <br>On this day, as we undertook the labor of cleansing the throne room, we did conclude that it would serve most excellently as our new abode. Yet, whilst engaged in this task, a wondrous discovery did present itself to the twins! The mirror contained within that chamber doth not merely reflect our own reminiscences but also doth reveal the memories of others and even the very structures scattered throughout this wretched edifice! Peering into its depths, I hath uncovered edifices within the domain of the Eternal Monarch that bring to mind the familiar comforts of home. It doth seem plausible that other denizens from Terra-Y might have found themselves ensnared within this realm. These Survivors might possess the knowledge required to escape this accursed dimension. As I understand it, we were among the first of many worlds to begin unravelling such grand cosmic enigmas, demonstrating that planets and solar systems are, indeed, sentient. The demise of the Lord of Blasphemy hath precipitated revelations that ushered in profound paradigm shifts, granting us the means to study realms beyond our own. Where once we presumed our knowledge to be comprehensive, these revelations have laid bare the scantness of our understanding of the world.
          <br>
          <br>NIGHT
          <br>Ere we retired for the night, Mary and I perused some memories through the mirror. We chanced upon a most peculiar maiden, hailing from the heavens of Terra-Y or perhaps Terra-58. My heart doth ache for her, for it seemeth that every endeavor she undertaketh yields naught but the inverse of her intention. In her attempt to aid her friends against an abuser, she hath unwittingly brought about the closure of the entire school, thus leaving many in a plight far worse than their former misfortune. Granted, spiking a narcissist's drink and watching him unravel was worth the price of admission. From the multitude of memories of those ensnared here, in struggles with such egotists, I have arrived at a singular conclusion regarding dealings with narcissists: one may either enable them, flee from them, or... destroy them. Yet, one must tread carefully, for a narcissist’s fall oft drags all who are near into the abyss with them.
          <br>
          <br>DAWN
          <br>I awoke, mine self bathed in blood, with no remembrance of what had befallen me through the dark hours. The blood dripped from mine nose and chin. I touched mine brow and scalp to find a deep and stinging wound. Was it an accident? Was it self-inflicted? Were it the dread of the fog? Creatures of the abyss? I knew not. Later, by our beds, I found a mound of purple flesh and gore. I cleansed the vile matter and cast it out the window into the abyss whence it came. I shall not tell them; I wish not to trouble them more than need be.
