          <br>Verily, through yon endless reaches of this dark dimension, hath we made a wondrous discovery. 
          A tower, akin to a lighthouse amidst a vast ocean of mist, doth beckon us with its enchanting 
          music. Some amongst us did recognize the melody, and swiftly traversed the fog to discover the
          tower, deserted by its erstwhile inhabitants.
          <br>
          <br>AFTERNOON
          <br>I still lack a clear image of who dwelt within yon tower, save that they relished writing and
          drinking, and diligently chronicled the souls ensnared within this realm.
          <br>
          <br>NIGHT
          <br>Some dub our sojourning abode as Dunwitch manor, while others favor the Arkham Hotel, and our
          playwright, Wilbur, doth insist on the Dunwitch manor, likening it to a tale from a dime 
          comic he once perused, drawn from the quill of Lovecraft. We hath cleared the chambers, and I have
          taken possession of the study wherein I discovered vinyl records and cassettes recounting tales 
          and musings of the prior dweller. The House, my preferred appelation, harbors artifacts and 
          contrivances from other realms i presume, whose workings do perplex. Yonder in the cellar, one 
          mirror do intrigue us grievouslyâ€”it doth emit a blue energy and seem to conjure memories from the 
          very air. Until its nature be comprehended, I have enjoined the forbidding of the basement.
          <br>
          <br>POSTSCRIPT
          <br>A few amongst us did read tales and partook of a modicum of whiskey ere retiring to our beds.
          'Twas indeed fine fare, serving to alleviate the cares of the day. I myself have commenced the study of the documents left by the last dweller or dwellers of this tower. Especial interest did I find in <a href="index.html" class="shh">one parchment</a> discovered within a most exquisite throne room. The chamber itself was strange, a disarray of papers and records, yet this one doth captivate me.
